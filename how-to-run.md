3. The results will be shown as an HTML file. There are two result sets - one based on direct matching, and the other based on frequency of matches, stored in `results.html` and `results.html` repsectively.  

   On Windows your HTML will be launched immediately on your default browser, while on MacOS/Linux (posix) you may have to launch `results.html` manually.
