# Installing and using the searcher

Download searcher.zip and follow the install instructions in ReadME.txt 

To make life easier, I've included the courseware PDF files in a ZIP, and all the PDF files as a list of images. 
These are in the coursewarePDFs.zip and pdfsAsImages.zip respectively. Both are available [here on my google drive]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N8Fei0VFpp_rvo0lf_FNeBTai58XDv3b?usp=sharing).
The file name from the search output matches the file names in pdfsAsImages.zip, allowing you to easily find file.
