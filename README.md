# What is jarPhys?

jarPhys is a PDF smart-search app, that's **designed to quickly run quick token matching based searches on a set of PDFs**.

Far from complete, jarPhys is still a small but fully functional project. As of now, jarPhys allows real-time search of pre-cached PDFs. 
Currently, jarPhys inputs documents images. So the best solution is to convert PDFs to PNG images using a tool like [PDF2PNG](https://pdf2png.com/). 

The real advantage jarPhys presents is avoiding searching through multiple (or very large) PDFs using CTRL-F (or however "find" works in your browser :P).
Since jarPhys does token matching, you also don't have to worry about not finding an exact match, similar to Google/Bing (lol).
The search interface is through a command-line for now, and the results for now are presented using an HTML, where the matched pages from PDFs are displayed.

**For me personally, a tool like this is helpful during exams/quizzes/tests or when trying to lookup material from a vague memory.
A great advantage is being able to search for questions without worrying about not finding "exact" matches.**

At some point, I'll make a complete browser run downloadable app, but for now this is it.
The name itself is a coinage from the combination Tony Stark's **Jar**vice bot, and the **Phy**sics (the sad hell in which we are united).

# **Installing and using the jarPhys-search**

1. Download the entire project as a ZIP File from the green download button ([link here as well](https://codeload.github.com/Magnus167/jarPhys/zip/refs/heads/main)).
   Extract the project to the desired and follow the install instructions in Install_Instruction.txt. The entire project is also mirrored on Google Drive ([link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18VgVaxoDj531Imugoc_VvvTUzCvTQdZ9?usp=sharing)).

2. Now you can search the pre-built database (all lecture notes/slides/past qps provided on KEATS).

   If you have any more similar resources (not very long books, but rather presentations, cheat-sheets, or past question papers), I'd be more than happy to add them, or guide you on how you can add to the database on your own. Adding your own resources and custom-building your database is a bit of an icky process now. But lookout for updates!
   And please, do give me your feedback wherever possible! It's highly appreciated.

3. Also, [buy me coffee please](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pt420). Appreciated :)
