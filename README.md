# Installing and using the jarPhys-search

1. Download the entire project as a ZIP File from the green download button ((link here as well)[https://codeload.github.com/Magnus167/jarPhys/zip/refs/heads/main]).
Extract the project to the desired and follow the install instructions in Install_Instruction.txt.

The entire project is also mirrored on Google Drive ([link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18VgVaxoDj531Imugoc_VvvTUzCvTQdZ9?usp=sharing)).

2. Now you can search the pre-built database (all lecture notes/slides/past qps provided on KEATS).

If you have any more similar resources (not very long books, but rather presentations, cheat-sheets, or past question papers), I'd be more than happy to add them, or guide you on how you can add to the database on your own. 
Adding your own resources and custom-building your database is a bit of an icky process now. But lookout for updates!

And please, do give me your feedback wherever possible! It's highly appreciated. 

3. Also, buy me coffee please. Appreciated :)
