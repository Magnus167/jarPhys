Installation instructions


1. Run installer.py
(To make check if you've done this correctly, you should have a folder called "database" with 3 folders [extracted, slides, output] inside.)

2. Run searcher.py!

Et viola!
Have fun!

Now you can search the pre-built database (all lecture notes/slides/past qps provided on KEATS).
If you have any more similar resources (not very long books, but rather presentations, cheat-sheets, or past question papers), I'd be more than happy to add them, or guide you on how you can add to the database on your own.
