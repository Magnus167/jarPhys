We have assumed an angle of 36\u00b0 between\nadjacent residues in the same chain, so that the\nstructure repeats after 10 residues on each chain, that\nis, after 34 A. The distance of a phosphorus atom\nfrom the fibre axis is 10 A. As the phosphates are on\nthe outside, cations have easy access to them.\n\nThe structure is an open one, and its water content\nigs rather high. At lower water contents we would\nexpect the bases to tilt so that the structure could\nbecome more compact.\n\nThe novel feature of the structure is the manner\nin which the two chains are held together by the\npurine and pyrimidine bases. The planes of the bases\nare perpendicular to the fibre axis. They are joined\ntogether in pairs, a single base from one chain being\nhydrogen-bonded to a single base from the other\nchain, so that the two lie side by side with identical\nz-co-ordinates. One of the pair must be a purine and\nthe other a pyrimidine for bonding to occur. The\nhydrogen bonds are made as follows : purine position\n1 to pyrimidine position 1; purine position 6 to\npyrimidine position 6.\n\nIf it is assumed that the bases only occur in the\nstructure in the most plausible tautomeric forms\n(that is, with the keto rather than the enol con-\nfigurations) it is found that only specific pairs of\nbases can bond together. These pairs are: adenine\n(purine) with thymine (pyrimidine), and guanine\n(purine) with cytosine (pyrimidine).\n\nIn dther words, if an adenine forms one member of\na pair, on either chain, then on these assumptions\nthe other member must be thymine; similarly for\nguanine and cytosine. The sequence of bases on a\nsingle chain does not appear to be restricted in any\nway. However, if only specific pairs of bases can be\nformed, it follows that if the sequence of bases on\none chain is given, then the sequence on the other\nchain is automatically determined.\n\nIt has been found experimentally*4 that the ratio\nof the amounts of adenine to thymine, and the ratio\nof guanine to cytosine, are always very close to unity\nfor deoxyribose nucleic acid.\n\nIt is probably impossible to build this structure\nwith a ribose sugar in place of the deoxyribose, as\nthe extra oxygen atom would make too close a van\nder Waals contact.\n\nThe previously published X-ray data** on deoxy-\nribose nucleic acid are insufficient for a rigorous test\nof our structure. So far as we can tell, it is roughly\ncompatible with the experimental data, but it must\nbe regarded as unproved until it has been checked\nagainst more exact results. Some of these are given\nin the following communications. We were not aware\nof the details of the results presented there when we\ndevised our structure, which rests mainly though not\nentirely on published experimental data and stereo-\nchemical arguments.\n\nIt has not escaped our notice that the specific\npairing we have postulated immediately suggests a\npossible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\n\nFull details of the structure, including the con-\nditions assumed in building it, together with a set\nof co-ordinates for the atoms, will be published\nelsewhere.\n\nWe are much indebted to Dr. Jerry Donohue for\nconstant advice and criticism, especially on inter-\natomic distances. We have also been stimulated by\na knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished\nexperimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F.\nWilkins, Dr. R. E.

This\nstructure has novel features which are of considerable\nbiological interest.\n\nA structure for nucleic acid has already been\nproposed by Pauling and Corey. They kindly made\ntheir manuscript available to us in advance of\npublication. Their model consists of three inter-\ntwined chains, with the phosphates near the fibre\naxis, and the bases on the outside. In our opinion,\nthis structure is unsatisfactory for two reasons:\n(1) We believe that the material which gives the\nX-ray diagrams is the salt, not the free acid. Without\nthe acidic hydrogen atoms it is not clear what forces\nwould hold the structure together, especially as the\nnegatively charged phosphates near the axis will\nrepel each other. (2) Some of the van der Waals\ndistances appear to be too small.\n\nAnother three-chain structure has also been sug-\ngested by Fraser (in the press). In his model the\nphosphates are on the outside and the bases on the\ninside, linked together by hydrogen bonds. This\nstructure as described is rather ill-defined, and for\nthis reason we shall not comment\non it.\n\nWe wish to put forward a\nradically different structure for\nthe salt of deoxyribose nucleic\nacid. This structure has two\nhelical chains each coiled round\nthe same axis (sce diagram).

The two chains (but\nnot their bases) are related by a\ndyad perpendicular to the fibre\naxis.

The purpose of\nthis communication is to describe, in a preliminary\nway, some of the experimental evidence for the poly-\nnucleotide chain configuration being helical, and\nexisting in this form when in the natural state. A\nfuller account of the work will be published shortly.\n\nThe structure of deoxypentose nucleic acid is the\nsame in all species (although the nitrogen base ratios\nalter considerably) in nucleoprotein, extracted or in\ncells, and in purified nucleate. The same linear group\nof polynucleotide chains may pack together parallel\nin different ways to give crystalline!-%, semi-crystalline\nor paracrystalline material. In all cases the X-ray\ndiffraction photograph consists of two regions, one\ndetermined largely by the regular spacing of nucleo-\ntides along the chain, and the other by the longer\nspacings of the chain configuration. The sequence of\ndifferent nitrogen bases along the chain is not made\nvisible.\n\nOriented paracrystalline deoxypentose nucleic acid\n(\u2018structure B\u2019 in the following communication by\nFranklin and Gosling) gives a fibre diagram as shown\nin Fig. 1 (cf. ref. 4). Astbury suggested that the\nstrong 3-4-A. reflexion corresponded to the inter-\nnucleotide repeat along the fibre axis. The ~ 34 A.\nlayer lines, however, are not due to a repeat of a\npolynucleotide composition, but to the chain con-\nfiguration repeat, which causes strong diffraction as\nthe nucleotide chains have higher density than the\ninterstitial water.
